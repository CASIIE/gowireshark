    Qt: Don't use QString::toLocal8Bit().

    As the QString::toLocal8Bit() documentation says,

    "On Unix systems this is equivalen to toUtf8(), on Windows the systems
    current code page is being used."

    This is problematic for the Packet Comments dialog, since the comments
    need to be UTF-8 as per the pcapng specification. Use toUtf8() instead
    there and in the Import Text dialog.

    Remove the toLocal8Bit() calls from the Extcap Options dialog since they
    weren'nt needed.

    Blind attempt at fixing #18698.

    test: Skip Follow HTTP2 test without Nghttp2

    The expected test output is with the headers decompressed, which
    we can't do without Nghttp2. (It outputs the compressed headers
    if we don't have it, so we could test for that instead.)

    kafka: Don't try to decompress if the length is zero.

    There's no point in trying to decompress a message with
    length zero, and some of the third party decompression
    libraries (e.g. zstd) can give unexpected results that
    lead to infinite loops if we do so. A message length zero
    is almost surely a file with errors.

    Double click is used for editing of some columns in dialog, but it

    Change lists noneditable columns (interface name and traffic graph) which
    starts capture. The rest of columns are editable by double click as before.

    Related to #18269. This patch fixes the code, doc update is other task.

    Welcome screen is fixed too. First column with excap symbol ignores

    CMake: Updates for CMake 3.25 and later on Windows.

    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.25.html says:

    "On Windows, when targeting the MSVC ABI, the find_library() command now
    accepts .a file names after first considering .lib. This is symmetric
    with existing behavior when targeting the GNU ABI, in which the command
    accepts .lib file names after first considering .a."

    If "MSVC" is defined, only search for libsmi-2. This keeps us from finding
    libsmi.a. Set NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH when we're searching for zlib. This
    keeps us from finding Strawberry Perl's version.

    Some SpanDSP builds link with LibTIFF, but our Windows version doesn't.

    rpm-setup: Don't attempt to install cmake3

    cmake is already in the basic list of packages. "cmake3" is
    necessary for RHEL/CentOS 7 (where the "cmake" package is 2.8.12),
    but that distribution isn't supported on 4.0 and later.

    At the same time, the OpenSUSE 15.4 repository accidentally has
    a "cmake3" package which is an earlier version than the "cmake" RPM,
    which creates some conflicts when trying to install both.
    (https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark-containers/-/jobs/3328997023)

    So, don't attempt to install cmake3 anymore.

    Qt: Make sure our font setting is backward compatible.

    Qt5's QFont::fromString() isn't compatible with Qt6's QFont::toString().
    If we were built with Qt5, don't try to process a font preference that
    was created by Qt6.

    Fixes #18553
